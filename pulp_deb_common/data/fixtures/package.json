    "Description": "lightweight C library for daemons - runtime library\n
libdaemon is a leightweight C library which eases the writing of UNIX
daemons.\n It consists of the following parts:\n .\n  * Wrapper around fork()
for correct daemonization of a process\n  * Wrapper around syslog() for simple
log output to syslog or STDERR\n  * An API for writing PID files\n  * An API
for serializing signals into a pipe for use with select() or poll()\n  * An API
for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to syslog\n .\n
Routines like these are included in most of the daemon software available. It\n
is not simple to get these done right and code duplication is not acceptable.\n
.\n This package includes the libdaemon run time shared library.",
